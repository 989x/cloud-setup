[EXAMPLES]
- Feature — unify data fetchers & add CTAs
  feat(api,app): unify getAll* helpers with strong types; add 'View all' CTAs

  Why
  * Remove duplicated “latest N” helpers and simplify wiring.
  * Provide consistent, strongly typed data access across the app.

  What
  * src/api/*: add types + getAll*() helpers (mock-backed).
  * App pages: refactor to use getAll*(); add category links and CTAs.

  Breaking changes
  * Deprecated getLatest*/getTop* helpers; replaced with getAll*().

- Fix — stabilize listing keys and slice bounds
  fix(app/catalog): correct key prop and slice bounds in listing

  Why
  * Prevent React key warnings and ensure stable rendering.

  What
  * Use composite keys; clamp slice to available length.

- UX — responsive breadcrumbs & category page
  feat(app/blog,components): add categories page, responsive breadcrumbs,
  and mock sort/pagination

  Why
  * Improve mobile usability and discoverability; keep user context.

  What
  * components/Breadcrumbs.tsx: truncation + ARIA labels, reused across pages.
  * app/blog/page.tsx: add 3 categories (static slugs) linking to
    /blog/category/[slug].
  * app/blog/category/sme/page.tsx: hero + listing via getAllPosts();
    dropdown sort (query string), condensed pagination UI.

  Breaking changes
  * None.

- Small change — single-line
  chore(ui): fine-tune h1 spacing on hero for better fold fit
