# Environment File Setup

This file is a **template**. Each **project on each server** must have **its own** `.env` at that project’s path.

## Create and edit

Replace `<PROJECT_DIR>` with your project’s absolute path:

```bash
nano <PROJECT_DIR>/.env
# save: Ctrl+O, Enter
# exit: Ctrl+X
````

**Examples**

```bash
nano /root/bookbook/backend/.env
nano /var/www/booking-plugin/.env
```
